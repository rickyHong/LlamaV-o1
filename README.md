## 🔥 Highlights

**LlamaV-o1** is a Large Multimodal Model capable of spontaneous reasoning.

- Our LlamaV-o1 model outperforms **Gemini-1.5-flash**,**GPT-4o-mini**, **Llama-3.2-Vision-Instruct**, **Mulberry**, and **Llava-CoT** on our proposed VCR-Bench.

- Our LlamaV-o1 model outperforms **Gemini-1.5-Pro**,**GPT-4o-mini**, **Llama-3.2-Vision-Instruct**, **Mulberry**, **Llava-CoT**, etc. on six challenging multimodal benchmarks (MMStar, MMBench, MMVet, MathVista, AI2D and Hallusion).

## Contributions 🏆
- Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning Benchmark: To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
benchmark is the first effort designed to evaluate multimodal multi-step reasoning tasks
across diverse topics. The proposed benchmark, named VRC-Bench, spans around eight
different categories (Visual Reasoning, Math & Logic Reasoning, Social & Cultural Context,
Medical Imaging (Basic Medical Science), Charts & Diagram Understanding, OCR &
Document Understanding, Complex Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning) with over
1,000 challenging samples and more than 4k reasoning steps.
- Novel Evaluation Metric: A metric that assesses the reasoning quality at the level of
individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence.
- Combined Multi-Step Curriculum Learning and Beam Search Approach: A multimodal rea-
soning method, named LlamaV-o1, that combines the structured progression of curriculum
learning with the efficiency of Beam Search. The proposed approach ensures incremental
skill development while optimizing reasoning paths, enabling the model to be effective in
complex multi-step visual reasoning tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifi-
cally, the proposed LlamaV-o1 achieves an absolute gain of 3.8% in terms of average score
across six benchmarks while being 5× faster, compared to the recent Llava-CoT.
